                    <h2>Why Fundamental Duties matter?</h2>
                    <p class="fd-para">Every citizen plays a key role in building a New India. Everyone performing their duties, even mechanically, would pave the way for a better neighborhood, better society, and ultimately, a better country.</p>
                    <p class="fd-para">
                    The idea of citizenship has acquired a new meaning, content and purpose in the democratic world. While emphasizing on rights, it very important that one is also sincere about his or her duties towards the society at large and the country. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fd-para">
                        Since ancient times, people in India have had a tradition of performing their duties. Since time immemorial, an individual’s kartavya — the performance of one’s duties towards society, his/her country and his/her parents — was emphasised. However, Modern civilisations do not offer many inducements for the performance of duties.

                Fundamental Duties must serve as a constant reminder of national goals as well as inculcate a profound sense of social responsibility. It is only through the fulfillment of duties, that we can live life to our truest potential and help lead nation towards prosperity. In fact, democracy cannot establish deep roots in society until the citizens don’t complement fundamental rights with their fundamental duties. <strong>
                    True nationalism is one where one follows the fundamental duty to its truest sense rather than showcasing false notion of nationalism.

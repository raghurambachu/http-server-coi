                    <h2>Significance of Fundamental Rights</h2>
                    <p class="fd-para">
                        Fundamental Rights are enshrined in the Constitution of India  which ensure the rights of citizens against arbitrary actions of the government and its machinery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fd-para">
                        Rights literally mean those freedoms which are essential for personal good as well as the good of the community. The rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India are fundamental as they have been incorporated into the Fundamental Law of the Land and are enforceable in a court of law. However, this does not mean that they are absolute or that they are immune from Constitutional amendment.
